Don't be too intimidated by the code 😱, if you read through it, it might actually make a little sense, even if you don't know quite what it does. This code wasn't written perfectly in the form you now see it. This is a garbage sentence meant as filler, or so you think twice about skipping over parts, lest you miss the good stuff. As I was saying, there were lots of mistakes and a healthy bit of swearing. I leaned on google heavily for almost every part of the code... you don't know what you're doing? Well, neither did/do I.

    "## Scraping Prelim data from https://scoring.dance\n",
    "Since there's no API for us or python to access the data programmatically, I opted to use web scraping with a library called `playwright`!\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping is great for accessing website data and clicking on buttons like a regular person browsing the interwebz. It can be fiddly though, as you have to tell the automated browser which things to click on. Fortunately, playwright + developer tools makes this fairly easy. A disadvantage to webscraping is that websites update frequently, so while it works when you make it, they might move a button later which breaks your code. API's usually have a set format that rarely, if ever, changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see below that I'm using the `async` version of playwright. This is likely because it's what I was using before, and I was too lazy to change it. It also allows me to convert this process to async in the future (if I want it to be faster). This unfortunately means we'll have to annoyingly sprinkle our code with the `await` command before some of the code can run.\n",
    "\n",
    "[This is video I learned from](https://youtu.be/lvFAuUcowT4?si=rYiOJHC4_Gdi26Ho&t=130), it uses `selenium` instead of `playwright` as the automated browser, but the concept is the same. Don't worry too much about why his programming environment looks differ"

I had to look through the documentation examples and test them out to see which ones I like.
